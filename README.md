#p r o t e c c - a game about protecting your little guys

###Made with [LÃ¶ve2D v11.1](https://love2d.org/)

###Author(s): Samuel J Kriever

##How it works
*Players are given a pen of little AI-driven mobs (prey)
*At the beginning of each round, a number of predators will enter the pen
*Predators and prey will be aware of one another once they come close enough
..*Prey will run away, while predators will chase them
..*The predators will wander about and try to eat the prey
*The player may perform certain actions to prevent the prey from being eaten
*At the end of the level (timer?) the predators will scatter, and the player will be scored based on the remaining prey

#TODO:
*Add mob-eating
*Add player-driven mechanics
*Add levels
*Add scoring
*Add menu/UI
